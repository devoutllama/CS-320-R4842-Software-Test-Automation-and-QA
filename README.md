**How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?**

the best ways to ensure a program is functional and secure are simple. First, please make sure good/rigorous testing. Code that isn't properly tested is more likely to have bugs that could be quite costly in the foreseeable future. Another is a form of testing, manual testing, where you review written code and examine it for any errors that have arisen during coding. Another way is to make use of secure coding practices, keep code clean, and easy to read, update any libraries involved in the development of the software, etc.

**How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?**

Any project that is undertaken involves taking user requirements. With user requirements, one can sometimes fully understand what is expected in a project. If any questions or problems arise, things like surveys, or just clarifying questions would go a long way in resolving those. With these clarified requirements, most of the work should be simple and clear-cut, so all one would need to do is stick to the requirements.

**How do I approach designing software?**

Building off the last answer, understanding the requirements laid out is key. The requirements are the guidebook for the project, without them one would be mostly lost. Next would be to choose an approach to developing the software. There are many, one of such being the AGILE methodology. This will allow one to refine and grow the design as the project progresses, allowing the team to make changes and adapt where needed. Good documentation will also help push the project in a positive direction as well, helping with growth, reviews, and the testing process.
